  <h2>Understanding and Redirecting Oral Fixation in Dementia</h2>


  <p>Oral fixation is something that can appear during the mid-stages of dementia and can be both confronting and exhausting for caregivers. It often shows up as a constant need to chew, bite, or put objects into the mouth. For my partner, it was a daily reality for many many years. He would chew on the duvet overnight, put pencils in his mouth, and sometimes even try to bite my fingers if I came too close. It wasn’t aggression—it was simply an instinctive behavior that neither of us could control.</p>

  <h3>Why Oral Fixation Happens</h3>
  <p>This behavior is often linked to changes in the brain that affect sensory processing and comfort-seeking behaviors. Chewing and mouthing objects may provide stimulation, help with self-soothing, or simply be a way to release restlessness. While it can feel overwhelming at times, it’s important to remember that it is not intentional misbehavior—it is part of the progression of dementia.</p>

  <h3>The Emotional Toll</h3>
  <p>As a caregiver, oral fixation can be emotionally challenging. It feels confronting to see your loved one chewing on bedding or biting through fabrics, especially when nothing seems to redirect the behavior. I remember offering towels to my partner, but his bite was so strong that he would chew right through them. There were times where I was purchasing a new duvet cover every few weeks as they became completely riddled with holes. One time I even had to replace the seatbelt in our car! At times I felt helpless, as though I was failing to give him the comfort or safety he needed. Like many aspects of dementia care, it was a lesson in patience, creativity, and acceptance.</p>

  <h3>Practical Ways to Redirect Oral Fixation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Safe Chewing Alternatives:</strong> Explore chewable items designed for adults, such as silicone sensory chews or non-toxic teething products. These are stronger and safer than towels or clothing.</li>
    <li><strong>Food-Based Options:</strong> Offer healthy, chewable snacks throughout the day (e.g., carrot sticks, apple slices if safe, or softer chewy foods depending on swallowing ability). This can redirect the need to chew into something nourishing.</li>
    <li><strong>Occupational Therapy Input:</strong> Ask an occupational therapist for suggestions on sensory tools or customized aids that can provide safe oral stimulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Oral Care:</strong> Sometimes oral fixation can be linked to discomfort in the mouth, such as dry mouth, gum issues, or ill-fitting dentures. Regular dental care and moisturizing mouth sprays may reduce the urge to chew.</li>
    <li><strong>Distraction and Engagement:</strong> Keep hands busy with soft fidgets, textured fabrics, or other calming activities to reduce the constant focus on chewing.</li>
  </ul>

 <h3>When Oral Fixation Becomes Teeth Grinding</h3>
 <p>As the disease progressed, my partner’s oral fixation developed into severe teeth grinding. It often sounded like rocks grinding against each other—harsh, relentless, and deeply distressing to witness. Unlike chewing, I never truly found a solution for this stage, other than making sure he wasn’t in any physical discomfort. What struck me was how much the grinding seemed to carry meaning. It often began when there were changes in his environment or when it felt like he wanted to say something but couldn’t. In a way, it became his form of communication, a signal that something inside him needed attention. Over time, I learned to accept it and even found small ways to soothe him—like holding his head in my hands, reassuring him that I was there, and loving him through it. It took me a long time to make peace with this, but eventually I found tenderness in those moments too.</p>


  <h3>Finding a Balance</h3>
  <p>Oral fixation doesn’t always disappear quickly. For us, it was something that lasted many years, and I had to learn to balance safety with acceptance. Redirecting the behavior when possible was important, but so was letting go of the idea that I could fully stop it. What helped most was shifting my perspective—from frustration to curiosity—asking myself, <em>what is he trying to get from this behavior, and how can I help meet that need safely?</em></p>

  <p><strong>If you’re facing oral fixation in your caregiving journey, know that you are not alone.</strong> It is one of many challenging behaviors that dementia can bring, and it requires patience, creativity, and a lot of compassion for both your loved one and yourself. While it can feel never-ending, there are ways to make it safer and more manageable, and over time, this too may pass as the disease continues to change.</p>
