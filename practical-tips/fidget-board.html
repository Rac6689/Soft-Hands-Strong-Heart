  <h2>How to Make a Fidget Board for a Loved One with Dementia</h2>
  <p>As dementia progresses, many people develop the need to keep their hands busy. This restlessness is not only natural but can also provide comfort when given a safe outlet. A fidget board (or busy board) is a simple, creative, and inexpensive way to meet this need. It engages the senses, stimulates the mind, and can ease anxiety while bringing a sense of purpose.</p>

  <h3>What Is a Fidget Board?</h3>
  <p>A fidget board is a flat surface (usually wood or sturdy cardboard) with a variety of objects attached for someone to touch, turn, click, slide, or explore. It provides tactile stimulation and can remind your loved one of everyday activities in a safe, playful way.</p>

  <h3>How I Made Mine</h3>
  <p>For my partner, I started with a piece of wood that I sawed into a square. I then screwed various objects onto it, such as hinges, an old light socket, and even a calculator. I even found a small prayer wheel that could be spun. Each piece gave him something different to fiddle with, and I noticed how calming it was for him to explore with his hands.</p>

  <h3>Materials You’ll Need</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A sturdy base – wood, MDF board, or thick cardboard</li>
    <li>Screws, nails, or strong glue (depending on the objects you’re attaching)</li>
    <li>A drill or screwdriver</li>
    <li>Sandpaper (to smooth edges and prevent splinters)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ideas for What to Add</h3>
  <p>Here are some creative and safe items you can attach to a fidget board:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hinges and latches</strong> – great for moving back and forth</li>
    <li><strong>Light switches</strong> – flipping on and off is soothing and familiar</li>
    <li><strong>Door handles or knobs</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Padlocks with keys</strong> – if safe and not sharp</li>
    <li><strong>Calculator or old phone keypad</strong> – pressing buttons can be very satisfying</li>
    <li><strong>Zippers</strong> – opening and closing provides rhythmic motion</li>
    <li><strong>Velcro strips</strong> – pulling them apart and pressing together again</li>
    <li><strong>Old remote control</strong> – pressing buttons</li>
    <li><strong>Soft fabric swatches</strong> – different textures for sensory comfort</li>
    <li><strong>Drawer pulls and handles</strong> – for sliding or turning</li>
    <li><strong>Spinners or wheels</strong> – something that rotates</li>
    <li><strong>Old locks or sliding bolts</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Beads on a string</strong> – to slide back and forth</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure all items are securely fastened so they cannot be swallowed or come loose.</li>
    <li>Sand down any sharp edges.</li>
    <li>Avoid very small objects, toxic materials, or anything sharp.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why It Helps</h3>
  <p>Fidget boards can reduce anxiety, ease agitation, and provide meaningful engagement for your loved one. They allow for repetitive movement, which is calming, and give the hands a sense of “work” that can feel grounding. Best of all, they can be personalized — filled with objects your loved one once used in daily life.</p>

  <h3>A Creative Gift of Love</h3>
  <p>Making a fidget board is more than a craft project — it’s a gesture of care. By gathering objects and arranging them thoughtfully, you’re creating not just a tool, but a way to say: <em>I see you, I value you, and I want you to feel safe and engaged.</em> You can buy or custom make a fidget board with meaningful items- the options are endless, let your creativity lead the way!</p>
