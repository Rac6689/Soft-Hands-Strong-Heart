    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Soft Hands, Strong Heart</strong>, a sanctuary for caregivers walking the tender path of love, loss, and devotion. My name is Rachel and I found myself on this unexpected journey ten years ago when my partner was first diagnosed with fronto temporal dementia. Some days, I still wonder how we found ourselves on this path — yet here we are, learning, stumbling, and finding our way through.

This is a space where caregiving is honored not only as a responsibility, but as a sacred journey — one that weaves together exhaustion and courage, grief and joy, despair and moments of quiet grace.

Here you’ll find reflections, gentle guidance, and practical tips, alongside spiritual nourishment: reminders that your story is unique, that your love matters, and that even the smallest acts of care hold a sacred beauty.

Whether you are tending a loved one through dementia or another long illness, may these words, practices, and offerings help you feel less alone. Think of this place as a companion — somewhere to pause, breathe, and remember that caregiving is not just survival, but also a path of meaning, healing, and deep connection.

Your hands are strong. Your heart is resilient. And here, you are held.

        <h3>Taking Ownership<br>as a Caregiver</h3>
        <p>I’ve been caregiving for over ten years, and for most of that time, I relied heavily on advice, guidance, and authority from others— doctors, nurses, caregivers, family, and friends. I thought that if I listened carefully, followed their instructions, and did what “experts” suggested, I would be doing the right thing for my partner and for myself....</p>

        <h3>Loving while Letting go</h3>
        <p>One of the most tender and complicated parts of caregiving is living with a slow goodbye. With dementia, the changes don’t happen all at once. They come gradually, like waves pulling someone you love further and further from shore. You can still see them, still touch them, still love them—yet in quiet ways, you are already beginning to grieve...</p>
