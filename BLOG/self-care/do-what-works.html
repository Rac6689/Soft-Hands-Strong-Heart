  <h2>Do What Works for You and What Makes You Happy</h2>
  <p>
    As caregivers, one of the first pieces of advice we often hear is: <em>“You need to take care of yourself first.”</em> While this comes from a loving and well-intentioned place, it can sometimes feel heavy. On the hardest days—when you can barely manage to feed yourself or keep up with the demands of caregiving—being told to “take care of yourself” can feel like another task added to an already overwhelming list. And worse, it can leave you feeling like you’re failing if you aren’t managing self-care in the ways others imagine you should.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, I’ve learned that self-care doesn’t have to look like what anyone else says it should. It’s about pausing, checking in with yourself, and asking: <em>“What do I really need right now?”</em> The answer might be very different depending on the day, your energy levels, or your emotional state—and that’s okay.
  </p>

  <h2>Listening to Your Own Needs</h2>
  <p>
    For me, evenings were often the hardest. By the time it got dark, I was physically and mentally drained. Instead of trying to push through and “be productive,” I started giving myself permission to go to bed early—at the same time as my partner. We would read together, or watch a light show, and then rest. For a long time, I criticized myself for my early bedtime, but in hindsight, I see it clearly: allowing myself to completely switch off was essential to my wellbeing. Now when I look back, those have been the most precious moments as we were able to spend time together just by being in eachothers presence without the roles of patient and caregiver. I now remember the soft glow of the salt lamp, the cat nuzzling into the sheets and the relaxation of just being.
  </p>

  <h2>Finding Joy in Small Ways</h2>
  <p>
    Another part of caring for myself has been making space—however small—for the activities that bring me joy. Some of my personal sources of happiness have been:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Soap making</li>
    <li>Gardening</li>
    <li>Knitting</li>
    <li>Creating nourishing meals</li>
    <li>Playing instruments</li>
    <li>Taking river dips</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Of course, I don’t have time to do all these things every day (and I don’t expect myself to). But even weaving in little moments—tending to a plant, playing one song, or enjoying a cup of tea—helps me stay connected to a sense of joy, creativity, and myself outside of caregiving.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Gentle Ways to Care for Yourself</h2>
  <p>
    Everyone’s situation is unique, but here are some ideas you might explore—not as prescriptions, but as possibilities to draw from if they feel right for you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rest without guilt.</strong> If your body and mind are tired, allow yourself to rest, even if the dishes aren’t done.</li>
    <li><strong>Create small rituals.</strong> Light a candle, sip your favorite tea, or listen to calming music as a daily moment just for you.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay connected to others.</strong> A phone call, a short visit, or even a text exchange can help you feel less alone.</li>
    <li><strong>Express yourself creatively.</strong> Whether it’s journaling, painting, crafting, or singing, creative expression can be healing.</li>
    <li><strong>Spend time in nature.</strong> A walk outside, sitting by a river, or simply stepping into the garden can be incredibly grounding.</li>
    <li><strong>Let go of “shoulds.”</strong> Self-care doesn’t need to follow someone else’s checklist. It’s about what genuinely supports <em>you</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Remember: You Are Doing Enough</h2>
  <p>
    Self-care doesn’t have to be perfect, elaborate, or fit a particular mold. It’s not about comparing yourself to others—it’s about honoring your own rhythms and needs. Some days, simply breathing through the moment and getting by is enough. On other days, you might find space to nurture your hobbies, relationships, or body.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wherever you are on this journey, know that you are doing your best—and that is enough. True self-care begins not with pressure, but with kindness toward yourself. Do what works for you. Do what makes you happy.
