    <h2>Long List of Activities for Early to Mid-Stage Dementia</h2>
    <p>
      Small, simple, purposeful activities can bring comfort, connection, and meaning 
      to days affected by dementia. Below is a long list of adaptable ideas for early 
      to mid-stage dementia — focused on sensory engagement, creative expression, 
      gentle movement and moments of belonging.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Why activities matter</h2>
    <p>
      Activities aren’t only a way to “pass time.” They help maintain identity, 
      provide gentle stimulation for memory and senses, reduce agitation, and create 
      opportunities for connection. The best activities are 
      <strong>simple, familiar, and focused on process rather than outcome</strong>. 
      Keep sessions short, be ready to adapt, and celebrate the small moments of joy.

    <h2>Gentle Creative Activities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adult colouring book</strong> This is great in the early stages for calming and focusing. You can remind your loved one to change colours and provide a variety of different books, based on preference.</li>
      <li><strong>Clay or soft modelling dough</strong> for tactile, hands-on exploration. This is a great activity but not for those who have an oral fixation and like putting things in their mouths!</li>
      <li><strong>Collage making</strong> from magazines or meaningful images or old photographs.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple crafts</strong> like stringing large beads, sorting buttons, or folding paper.</li>
      <li><strong>Music-making</strong> with shakers, tanbourines, drums, a xylophone or singing familiar songs together. A handpan is a beautiful instrument as you can play any note and it still sounds pleasant.</li>
      <li><strong>Wooden shape mandala making</strong> My partner had a set of wooden shapes which he used to create patterns and sort into colours or shapes.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sensory Activities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hand massage</strong> using unscented lotion or a scented or infused oils if tolerated.</li>
      <li><strong>Scent exploration</strong> with herbs, essential oils, citrus peel or lavender sachets.</li>
      <li><strong>Folding soft laundry</strong> — repetitive, purposeful, comforting.</li>
      <li><strong>Tactile boxes</strong> filled with shells, feathers, stones, fabric scraps.</li>
      <li><strong>Listening to music</strong> or nature recordings to calm and orient.</li>
       <li><strong>Fidget or Sensory board or blanket</strong> which you can place on lap and customise with a variety of fidget objects. I created a board for my partner with hinges, keys, a calculator, various buttons on switches that he could fiddle with. I even nailed a xylophone to it which he could play. I had blanket version of this with softer fidget items like pom poms, shoe laces, embroidered messages and various textures that he could touch. He used the soft one right into late stage dementia by which time it became a nice blanket to look at.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Outdoor & Nature</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gardening</strong> — watering pots, planting bulbs, light weeding.</li>
      <li><strong>Bird watching</strong> with a feeder or binoculars.</li>
      <li><strong>Short walks</strong> in safe, familiar places.</li>
      <li><strong>Collecting leaves or flowers</strong> for pressing or arranging.</li>
      <li><strong>Sitting outside</strong> to feel sun, wind, and listen to the day. A large rocking or egg chair can be very calming.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Social & Connection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photo albums</strong> — look through pictures and prompt stories.</li>
      <li><strong>Reminiscence with objects</strong> (kitchen tools, mementos).</li>
      <li><strong>Reading aloud</strong> short poems, prayers, or gentle prose.</li>
      <li><strong>Group games</strong> like balloon toss, passing a soft ball, or matching cards.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared rituals</strong> — daily tea, lighting a candle, gratitude moments.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Household Tasks that Give Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Folding towels or napkins</strong> — repetitive and meaningful.</li>
      <li><strong>Setting the table</strong> with guidance — a sense of contribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Helping with food prep</strong> (washing vegetables, stirring batter).</li>
      <li><strong>Light sweeping or wiping</strong> of a small area.</li>
      <li><strong>Sorting tasks</strong> (coins, buttons, postcards) that provide focus.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Gentle Physical Activities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chair-based stretches</strong> — slow and guided.</li>
      <li><strong>Dancing to familiar music</strong> — even small rhythmic sways.</li>
      <li><strong>Tai Chi or balancing exercises</strong> adapted to ability.</li>
      <li><strong>Balloon or soft ball games</strong> for hand-eye coordination.</li>
      <li><strong>Short walks</strong> indoors or outdoors at a comfortable pace.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Cognitive & Memory-Friendly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Large-piece puzzles</strong> or wooden jigsaws.</li>
      <li><strong>Matching games</strong> with animals, colours, or images.</li>
      <li><strong>Audio stories or short audiobooks</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Word play</strong> like naming objects or rhyming.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple card games</strong> with gentle adaptation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep it short.</strong> 10–20 minutes is often enough.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare the space.</strong> Remove hazards and clutter.</li>
      <li><strong>Use familiar cues.</strong> Photos, music, and routines help.</li>
      <li><strong>Offer choices.</strong> Two simple options work better than open-ended.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on process not product.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Be ready to adapt.</strong> If frustration arises, switch gently.</li>
      <li><strong>Include small rituals.</strong> Like a song, blessing, or shared sip of tea.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Every person’s journey with dementia is unique. Use this list as a menu rather 
      than a checklist — pick what resonates and let rhythms guide you. The aim is 
      connection, dignity, and gentle engagement. Even small moments of laughter, 
      recognition, or calm are meaningful and worth celebrating.
    </p>

      <strong>If you find an activity that helps, note it down — over time you’ll 
      build a personal list of what brings comfort and joy.</strong>
