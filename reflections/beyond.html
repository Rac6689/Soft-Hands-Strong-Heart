  <h2>Beyond Memory: The Essence That Remains</h2>

  <p>Dementia is often spoken of as loss — a fading of memory, of words, of who someone “used to be.” And yet, I have come to see that something deeper endures: the essence of a person, the quiet flame that is never extinguished. This idea of loss has always upset me, perhaps because I am sensitive and naturally feel into the hearts of others, sensing more than what appears on the surface. I have learned that as the outer layers fall away, the true essence of a person can shine even more brightly, and in that light, there is a profound beauty and presence that cannot be taken away.</p>


  <h2>From Restlessness to Presence</h2>
  <p>In the early years, my partner was restless, anxious, always needing to be on the move. Caring for him felt like tending to a small child. He would tell me his whole life story, from birth to that very day, again and again, as if making sense of everything — the joys, the traumas, the moments that shaped him. It was exhausting, yet sacred.</p>

  <p>Then one day, the stories stopped. As if he had released it all. Life began happening in the present. Over the years, a stillness has grown. Now, as he nears the end of his journey, I feel the essence of him more clearly than ever. He watches the world and those around him with quiet attentiveness. When our eyes meet, there is a knowing, a peace, a love that flows beyond words. In that gaze, I see him fully, and he allows me to see into his soul.</p>

  <h2>The Spiritual Lens</h2>
  <p>Across spiritual traditions, the essence of a person is eternal — beyond the body, beyond memory, beyond time. Some call it the soul, others the spirit or life force. Dementia may strip away the outer layers, but it cannot touch this inner truth. In its own way, it even reveals it: we are invited to meet our loved one in their pure being, free from expectation, fully in the present.</p>

  <h2>Meeting Essence in Daily Life</h2>
  <p>Essence is found in the small, quiet moments: a hand held, a shared silence, a gaze that lingers. When we release who we expect our loved one to be, we see who they are now — not less, not gone, but deeply themselves. Each presence, each touch, each smile becomes a doorway to the soul.</p>

  <h2>Never Lost</h2>
  <p>Is the essence of a person ever lost? I believe not. Memory fades, stories dissolve, identities shift, but essence endures. It is the eternal thread woven through every stage of life. Dementia changes the surface, but the heart, the soul, the being — remains. And in that knowing, I meet my partner with reverence, gratitude, and love, beyond memory, beyond time, beyond loss.</p>
