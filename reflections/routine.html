  <h2>Our Daily Routine in Late-Stage Dementia</h2>
  

  <p>Every day has its own shape, but routines give us a kind of gentle scaffolding — small rituals that hold meaning, help with safety, and create pockets of connection. Below is a typical day for us. I share it not as prescription, but as a lived example: what helps us, how we create softness in busy tasks, and how I try to protect moments of kindness for both of us.</p>

  <h3>Mornings: music, care, and small rituals</h3>
  <p>I rise first and prepare breakfast for both of us while playing morning Sikh prayers for my partner. The music fills the house and brings a calmness that settles him while he is still in bed.</p>

  <p>When it’s time, I gently get him up for a shower and then settle him into his chair. I wash his face with a couple of drops of lavender oil — the scent helps him relax. With gloves on, I take a few minutes to do gentle hand exercises to help open his hands, and we listen to music while I work with him.</p>

  <p>I feed him breakfast and a cup of tea, then position him slightly forward to help any fluid drain. While he rests and listens to music, I move through the morning chores: vacuuming, a load of laundry, and attending to his catheter. Music keeps the space warm and less clinical.</p>

  <h3>If there’s time: grounding in the garden</h3>
  <p>On mornings when there’s time, I step outside into the garden for some light weeding and clearing. That small contact with soil and sky helps me feel connected to nature and steadies me for the day ahead.</p>

  <h3>Midday: fluids, movement, and lunch</h3>
  <p>Hydration is important, and because my partner has swallowing difficulties, getting fluids in can be a challenge. I aim for about two cups of tea before lunch. To help with swallowing and fluid congestion I encourage him to move up and down in his chair and to walk gently around the house when possible; small changes in position often help.</p>

  <p>When it’s time for lunch I prepare pureed vegetables and protein for him and something nourishing for myself. He needs feeding, so I try to eat first when I can — a little fuel makes a big difference in my energy and patience.</p>

  <h3>Our daily outing: ritual and movement</h3>
  <p>Our outing is a cherished part of our routine. I carefully move him into a transition chair, put his shoes on, and help him into the car. We often play Sufi music on the drive into town; music grounds us and creates continuity from home to the outside world.</p>

  <p>In town I transfer him into his wheelchair, arrange special pressure cushions, cover him with a blanket, and we go for a walk along the river, do a little shopping, or simply potter about. These small excursions refresh both of us — a change of scenery, some fresh air, and the gentle rhythm of being among people without expectation.</p>

  <h3>Afternoon: practical care and another cup of tea</h3>
  <p>When we return home I take him to the toilet (which can be one of the more challenging parts of the day), encourage another couple of cups of herbal tea for hydration, and settle him back into his chair for our evening routine. Often this is a quieter part of the day: music, rest, and gentle attention.</p>

  <h3>Evening: nourishment and winding down</h3>
  <p>In the evening I prepare soup and a light meal for myself. I feed him before finishing the evening routine: brushing teeth, settling him into bed, tucking the blanket in, and creating a calm bedside space for the night. Small rituals — a lamp turned low, a hand on his shoulder, a soft song — help both of us move toward sleep.</p>

  <h3>Notes & practices that help</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Music as a throughline:</strong> playing familiar or comforting music during transfers, meals, and outings creates continuity and soothes agitation.</li>
    <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> small positional changes (leaning forward, walking a few steps) can help with swallowing and fluid movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-care in small doses:</strong> stepping into the garden for five minutes, eating a proper meal before feeding him, and short grounding rituals keep me steadier.</li>
    <li><strong>Softening tasks:</strong> using lavender oil for a face wash, warm blankets, and slow movements helps the practical tasks feel more tender.</li>
    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> having pressure cushions, blankets, and a small care kit ready for outings reduces stress during transitions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>On imperfection and patience</h3>
  <p>No routine is perfect. Some days are harder than others; outings may be cut short, or feeding may be a battle. I try to hold compassion for myself in those moments — to remember that effort, presence, and small kindnesses matter even when everything doesn’t go as planned.</p>

  <p>If you read this and wonder whether your day looks “right”: there is no single right way. These small rituals and adaptations are how we make space for dignity, comfort, and connection in the everyday. I share this so other caregivers might recognise familiar patterns — and to offer the quiet reassurance that you are doing meaningful work, even when it feels ordinary.</p>
