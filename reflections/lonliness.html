  <h2>Caregiving, Loneliness, and Isolation</h2>
  
  <p>Caring for someone you love is deeply rewarding, but it can also be profoundly isolating. My partner used to be very social, and we were always surrounded by people—family, friends, neighbors. Since his diagnosis with frontotemporal dementia, most people have gradually disappeared from our lives, including most family and friends. Now only a handful remain, and it isn’t always who I expected.</p>

  <p>Diseases like dementia, grief, and the reality of mortality can scare people away. Often their discomfort reflects their own fears, and they distance themselves rather than face what is difficult or painful. This can leave both the caregiver and the person being cared for feeling profoundly alone.</p>

  <p>There isn’t a neat answer to this. Loneliness is a reality for many caregivers, and it can be hard not to feel abandoned or overlooked. But I want you to know this: <strong>you are not alone, and this is not your fault.</strong> The distancing of others is not a reflection of your worth or the love you give; it is a reflection of their own fears and discomfort. There have been times where this reality has left me feeling angry, resentful, and bitter at the world, yet this only led me into a spiral of negativity that hurt both me and the care I am able to give.</p>

  <p>I have had to learn to forgive, let go, and focus on the things that bring me joy and happiness as well as forging a relationship to myself. I’m not always perfect at this—there are times when anger and resentment still creep in, and that is okay. I accept that too. I know letting go of our expectations of others can be easier said than done, but in the long run, embracing this mindset allows me to care from a place of love and presence rather than frustration. It creates space for moments of peace, connection, and even gratitude amidst the challenges I face. I also have to often remind myself that there is a difference between lonliness and being alone and that even when others don't show up as I would like them to, I always have the opportunity to nurture the relationship I have with myself. The bond I have nurtured with myself is now becoming so strong and is something that will always be with me.</p>

  <p>That said, external realtionship remain important. As a society, we also need to get better at reaching out. Caregivers benefit so much when others step beyond their own discomfort to simply be present, to listen, and to offer support. Sharing our stories and opening our hearts can inspire others to do the same, creating ripples of compassion that extend far beyond our immediate circles.</p>

  <p>This path has taught me the importance of reaching out—not only for help, but also to connect with others, to share experiences, and to nurture the human bonds that sustain us. While loneliness may be an inevitable part of caregiving at times, <strong>connection, understanding, and self-compassion are always within reach.</strong></p>
