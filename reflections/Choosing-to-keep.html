  <h2>Choosing to Keep My Partner at Home</h2>

  <p><em>Before I begin, I want to acknowledge that every caregiving journey is unique. For some, placing a loved one in care is the most loving and necessary choice, and I have deep respect for that. What I share here is simply my personal path—the decision to keep my partner at home, even when many people told me it wasn’t possible. I share this not as advice or a judgment, but as encouragement for anyone who might feel the same pull in their heart and needs to know they are not alone.</em></p>

  <p>One of the things I heard again and again when my partner was diagnosed was that I wouldn’t be able to keep him at home. Professionals, well-meaning friends, and even other caregivers told me there would come a time when I would have to place him in care. This message can be terrifying, especially if—like me— you feel in your heart that home is where your loved one belongs.</p>


  <p>Voicing this was not always easy. Sometimes I felt judged for it. A woman once told me, “You will never have a life,” and even though I knew those words came from her own grief and experience of placing her husband in care, they stung deeply. They made me feel like an outsider for choosing a different path.</p>

  <p>Even now, I sometimes feel that quiet sense of judgement, as though I am walking a road that few people understand. I hear comments like, “He would never have survived so long if it wasn’t for your care,” or “When are you going to place him?” I know most of these words are not meant to hurt, but they can leave me feeling unseen in my truth. </p>

  <p>Perhaps what complicates things further is that I am much younger than my partner. People sometimes look at me and think I should be living my life in a different way. But this <em>is</em> my life. I chose it with love, and I continue to choose it every day. Yes, it is demanding and often exhausting, but it is also deeply meaningful and aligned with who I am.</p>

  <p>I share this not to convince anyone to follow the same path, but to say that if your heart calls you to do something that doesn’t match the dominant narrative, it’s okay. You don’t have to apologize for choosing differently. Caregiving is as unique as the love story that underpins it. For me, keeping my partner at home is not a burden I carry—it’s a commitment I live, rooted in love.</p>
